# AID_NeurIPS_2021
Small repository dedicated to the reproducability of the Engineers for Exploration's Automated Acoustic Species Identification's results for their publication in the Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning at NeurIPS 2021 

4 Datasets used: ~~https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gtTdxwn18y2FFVhyEhdWNGcJvXfayoeI?usp=sharing~~
Unfortunately, due to recent Google Drive Storage Restrictions, this dataset is not as readily available to the public as it used to be. Please email the Project Lead(s) of the Automated Acoustic Species Identification team at the Engineers for Exploration lab at University of California San Diego if you are interested in the data: https://e4e.ucsd.edu/acoustic-species-identification

If there is any interest in the full dataset that was collected at the Scripps Coastal Reserve Biodiversity Trail, please feel free to reach out!
